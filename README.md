# NLP HW3: Naive Bayes Classifier from Scratch
## By: Tyler Faulkner

I originally completed the homework using scikit-learn, but realiezed this was meant to be from scratch
The old code is under the folder "old_with_scikit".

The are four main file, each nearly the same. The represent each addition to the dataset.

The only non standard library being used is numpy.

Original is just the provided small dataset
Additional is including the manually created training data.
MPQA is including the MPQA lexicon.
Amazon is using the Amazon reviews dataset.

The naive_bayes.py file contains the NaiveBayes class, which is used to train and test the model. Nearly the logic is in this class.

The code is written in Python 3.10.x.

I am including the origianl and MPQA datasets in the repo since they are small. The Amazon dataset will need to be included on your own if you want to run the amazon script.
